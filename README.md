### :fountain: Learnings and challenges
A lot of React learnings, useContext for global state and started creating my own hooks to name two.
A lot of troubleshooting and time spent understanding TypeScript - this was probably the most time consuming part. Interfaces.
General struggles with setting up database and creating functionality for Some struggles getting a grasp of working with MongoDB, and writing functionality for working with data.
I continuously improve my knowledge in architecture, in order to create more maintainable code. This is, and has been, one of my main priorities, since it helps me make sense of how to structure and plan an application.
Becoming better at using Trello to keep track on and manage tasks.

### :construction: Improvements and bug fixes
Styling and adding functionality to admin/order page. Currently just showing the orders.
Filter function on products page.
Overall clean-up of design.
Manually putting in URL, e.g. “[https://hyper-6-ecom.netlify.app/products](https://hyper-6-ecom.netlify.app/products)” breaks page.

### :flying_saucer: Take-aways for the future
I want and need to start writing tests for my code. 
I must become better at writing comments and documenting what I do. This project was a fall forward but there’s a lot of improvements to make.
CI/CD.
Started creating a design system in Figma I will benefit from using down the line.
Using Trello for task management is a super power.
